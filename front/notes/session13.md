## YDKJSY: book1, chapter4 and appendix A
### chapter4:
Why do most people belive that JS is not lexically scoped?
  
How did JS developers implement inheritance feature without using class?
  
Don't hurry. Be patient. Change your programming approach step by step. At first you can have a deeper look and check how exactly your JS code runs. Don't be afraid of going against the crowd.
  
### Appendix A:
  
What is the output of below code?
  
```
var someFunctiom = function functionName (){
  //do some thing.
};
console.log(someFunction.name);
```

What is the output of below code?
  
```
var x = "false";
if(x){
  console.log(x);
}
```
